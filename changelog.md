# Notes

I am still trying to hammer out the game loop and such still, but right now I definitely want it to have to do something with being a farmer and trying to find this skin walker before it finds you type ordeal.

Maybe each night you don't find it, it grows stronger at an increasing rate??
I like the idea of it being more endless.
I also kinda like that gameplay loop of you try and you find out if you succeded when the night is over.

Maybe you get a limited number of shotgun shells a night and, of course you are trying to keep your live stock.

Each night you don't find and shoot the skin-walker the skin walker grows stronger. It get's more agressive every night and with more strength.

I would like a feature where maybe you have a barn dog and you can send it to sniff some cattle or live stock and if it finds something it will bark at it. The downside though is that the dog isn't always accurate, maybe a 50/50 chance it finds it then tuckers out for the night. There is also a change the skin walker eats your dog and you don't know.
Outside of that I would like it be more like an inspection game where you can check the animals and when it recreates an animal it isn't perfect and there are things you can check for.
Maybe like the sound it makes is pitched slightly wrong, or one ear is too small etc. If you are checking one and you take too long and it is the skin walker, maybe it eats you. As it gets more aggressive maybe it shifts more, and you might be able to catch it shifting or eating your live stock. It also attacks quicker if you check it, and if it gets strong enough, maybe it starts trying to creep up on you when you aren't looking at it.

I would also like it to have a end, maybe you have to survive so many nights, something to do with a temporary sunspot or really poor weather causing it too be dark. Actually maybe wild fires, and there is ash that will clear out. Also all the lore about it shifting into people and myths like that over the years, but maybe there is like an article or something on like a mythology website saying that it has taken to mostly animals as they are much easier to get away with because humans and tell humans too well and they have language and all that.

I kinda also want to do at the end of each night, it tells you if you got it, or if it still lurks. If it grows stronger, etc. Maybe when you kill an animal there is no perfect signal that that was it???

I think there are three things that the monster should be able to fail to copy.
The behavior,
A physical attribute,
or a sound.

When it shifts one of those three should "fail".
